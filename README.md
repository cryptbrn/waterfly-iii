**Unofficial** Android App for [Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii), a free and open source personal finance manager.

The app design is heavily influenced by [Bluecoins](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rammigsoftware.bluecoins).

## Features

The app is still pretty much work in progress, but basic features already do work:

- General
  - Light & Dark Mode
  - Translation Ready (currently only translated into German)
  - Listen to incoming notifications (e.g., from Google Pay or your banking app) and pre-fill transactions
- Dashboard
  - Multiple charts for the current balance & recent history
  - Budget overview for last 30 days
- Transactions
  - List transactions by date, including filters
  - Add & edit transactions with autocomplete, including attachments, split transactions & multi currency support
- Balance Sheet
  - List individual balances
- Piggy Banks
  - View Piggy Banks
  - Add/Remove money from Piggy Banks
- Accounts
  - List all asset/expense/revenue/liability accounts

### Planned Features

The app does **not** try to replicate every single feature that the Webinterface has. Instead, it tries to be a good *companion* to access the most used functions on-the-go. More in-depth operations such as creating or deleting asset accounts, creating or modifying rules etc. are not planned.

- More filter options
- ... and more.

## Technology

The app is built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and tries to keep to the [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) design guidelines. Additionally, I try to keep the app as "lean" as possible, without external trackers or unneeded dependency on external packages.

## Motivation

Having troubles with [Bluecoins](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rammigsoftware.bluecoins) syncing across devices and not always storing attachments online, I was looking for a self-hosted alternative and discovered [Firefly III](https://www.firefly-iii.org/). After a [quick script to migrate from Bluecoins to Firefly](https://github.com/dreautall/bluecoins-to-fireflyiii), the only thing left was to download an app to easy track expenses on-the-go... or so I thought.

Unfortunately, I discovered that the existing Android Apps for Firefly III are either outdated or very buggy and hardly maintained. Always wanting to use Flutter for something, I started to make my own app, modeling it after the Bluecoins app I used so far and whose interface I really liked.
